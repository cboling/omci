# OMCI

OMCI gopacket library supports the encoding and decoding of ITU G.988 OMCI
messages. It is currently a work in progress.

## Message Types supported and under unit test
The following OMCI message types currently have been coded and are covered
by unit tests.

 - CreateRequest
 - CreateResponse
 - DeleteRequest
 - DeleteResponse
 - SetRequest
 - GetRequest
 - GetAllAlarmsRequest
 - GetAllAlarmsResponse
 - GetAllAlarmsNextRequest
 - MibUploadRequest
 - MibUploadResponse
 - MibUploadNextRequest
 - MibResetRequest
 - MibResetResponse
 - SynchronizeTimeRequest
 - GetNextRequest
 - GetNextResponse

## Message Types supported but lacking full unit test
The following OMCI message types currently have been coded and are partially covered
by unit tests, but work still remains for sufficient unit test coverage.

 - SetResponse
 - GetResponse
 - GetAllAlarmsNextResponse
 - MibUploadNextResponse
 - SynchronizeTimeResponse
 - AttributeValueChange

## Message Types supported but lacking any unit test
The following OMCI message types currently have been coded but any unit test coverage.

 - RebootRequest
 - RebootResponse
 - StartSoftwareDownloadResponse
 - StartSoftwareDownloadRequest
 - DownloadSectionRequest
 - DownloadSectionResponse
 - EndSoftwareDownloadRequest
 - EndSoftwareDownloadResponse
 - ActivateSoftwareRequest
 - ActivateSoftwareResponse
 - CommitSoftwareRequest
 - CommitSoftwareResponse
 - GetCurrentDataRequest
 - GetCurrentDataResponse
 - AlarmNotification
 
## Message Types not yet supported

The following OMCI message types currently have not been coded.

 - TestResult
 - TestRequest
 - TestResponse
 - SetTableRequest
 - SetTableResponse

## Current user-test coverage


## Other outstanding items

Besides OMCI Message decode/serialization, and associated unit tests, the following items
would be needed or useful in a first official release of this library. Some changes are
to be done in the generated OMCI ME code as well.

 - Specific examples of how to use this library (expand upon DecodeEncode.go examples)
   Include unknown ME examples and how to catch various common or expected errors
 - Add Alarm Table Support (generated MEs also)
 - Add AVC flag for appropriate attributes
 - For serialization, check early for message size exceeded
 - Check proper gopacket use of Payload/Contents properties and make sure we
   follow guidelines (if there are any)
 - For 'mebase.go' string output, look up ME name and output as needed
 - Look through 'error' messages and see if there are a few very common ones that
   could be moved to a custom class to allow for better user interception/decode of
   these errors.
 
The following would be 'nice' to have but are not necessary for initial code release
 - Extended message support
 - MIC Encode/Decode support

## Create requests
Currently the OMCI parser does not decode the default Set-By-Create attribute values
from the ITU document. So for attributes that do not have a default of zero, you must
specify the defaults if you use the 'meframe.go' routine to create a CreateRequest
for a specific Managed Entity Instance.
